      <h1>Kathmandu</h1>
      <p>
        Kathmandu, the capital and largest city in Nepal, is like no other city
        in the world. The decaying buildings in the heart of the city are a
        stark contrast to the lively atmosphere that permeates the streets. The
        smell of incense wafts from stores while street sellers push their
        goods, and people go about their daily lives, all against a backdrop of
        historic temples and carved statues.For several hundred years, Kathmandu
        was one of three rival royal cities, along with Bhaktapur and Patan.
        Situated in close proximity to each other, today these three almost run
        together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The highlight of Kathmandu has long been Durbar Square, the largest of
        the palace squares in the three royal cities and a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site. Temples and monuments of varying shapes, sizes, styles, and faiths
        can be found here.Kathmandu's Durbar Square was severely damaged in the
        2015 earthquake, with many buildings destroyed beyond repair, but it
        still remains a special place to visit.
      </p>

      <h2>Pashupati</h2>
      <p>
        Hinduism is the most widely followed religion in Nepal. The country has
        embraced this religion and respects it with several sacred places of
        interest, including Pashupatinath Temple. The sacred place is considered
        one of the most important temples in the world and one of the most
        visited tourist places in Kathmandu. The complex is on UNESCO World
        Heritage Sites list for decades. The extensive Hindu temple has a
        sprawling collection of images, inscriptions, ashrams, temples and
        images.
      </p>

      <h2>Boudhanath Stupa</h2>
      <p>
        A UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the largest stupas in the world,
        the Boudhanath Stupa in Kathmandu is a significant place in Buddhism and
        architecture, both. Located on an ancient trade route that entered
        Kathmandu from Tibet.The place has seen many traders and travellers
        offering prayers to their lord here, as the Stupa is considered to be
        the tomb of the remains of Kassapa Buddha. With a lot of legends
        attached to the place, it is one of the best places to visit in Nepal
        and easily deserves to be called so.
      </p>
      <h2>Swayambhunath Stupa</h2>
      <p>
        Situated on top of a hill in the Kathmandu Valley, this tourist place in
        Kathmandu is an ancient architectural marvel is one of the best
        attractions of the city. The entire complex is surrounded by a wide
        variety of trees. It comprises of the main stupa, many shrines, temples,
        monastery, museum and a well-stocked library. The temples are painted
        with the eyes and eyebrows of the Buddha with the number 1 in local
        script painted as the nose of the lord, which is a sight to behold in
        itself.

    <article id="pokhara">
      <h1>Pokhara</h1>
      <p>
        Pokhara is the city of lakes. There are several lakes in Pokhara and the
        prominent ones are Fewa Lake, Rupa Lake and Begnas Lake. Among these
        lakes, Fewa Lake is by far the most beautiful lake. Nestled on a little
        island on Fewa Lake is the Barahi Temple. For a small charge, you can go
        on a boat ride on this lake. The sunlight reflects on the lake and
        glitters and the mountains smile upon us in the reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can walk on the Lakeside enjoying the sight which is an incredible
        experience. I regret the fact that when I was a resident here in Pokhara
        I overlooked its charms. Lakeside is even prettier in the late evenings,
        under the soft glow of lamp posts hung upon the creatively built
        restaurants and shops. You can dine here while enjoying the live
        entertainments. Other attractions of Pokhara are Davis Fall which is a
        beautiful waterfall and Buddha Stupa. Then there is Sarangkot which is a
        towering hill that offers a magnificent view of Pokhara from its hill
        top.
      </p>

      <h2>Phewa Lake</h2>
      <p>
        Phewa Lake is a very famous lake located in Kaski District, Gandaki
        Province of Nepal. Located in the Pokhara Valley, this lake is popular
        among internal and external tourists. The name of this lake is Phewa
        Lake as it is near the village of Phewa. It is also called Baidam Lake
        as it falls near the village. In the meanwhile, the location of ‘Barahi
        Mandir’ has made it possible to identify it in Barah Mandir as well. The
        lake has a panoramic view of Machhapuchhre and Annapurna Himal. These
        scenes bring joy to everyone’s mind. The view of the sunrise and sunset
        is also very stunning and makes the mind happy
      </p>
    
      <h2>Sikles</h2>
      <p>
        Sikles is a beautiful indigenous Gurung village located in Kaski
        District.This beautiful trek is a great preface to the beauty of the
        Annapurna range and the rich culture and their lifestyle of Gurung
        community. Sikles is one of the largest model trekking Gurung village in
        Nepal and offers an opportunity to learn about this unique traditional
        culture. This route is manage and conserved by the Annapurna
        Conservation Area and the community to promote tourism. Sikles
        Village and Kaphuche trekking is a short and perfect destination from
        Pokhara towards Annapurna range of view including Lamjung Himal. It is
        roughly 5 hour bus ride from Pokhara. Sikles is located above Madi Khola
        at an altitude of 1,981m.

        <h2>Sarangkot</h2>
        <p>
            A small village which has its own natural beauty. The best thing about 
            the village of Sarangkot is that it lies in the outskirts of the Pokhara city. 
            Moreover, you will alo get a chance to view the one of the most beautiful Annapurna 
            Himalayan range. You can also view the orange hues along with some beautiful mountain ranges.
